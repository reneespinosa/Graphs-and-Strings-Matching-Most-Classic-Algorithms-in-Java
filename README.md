# Classic Graph and String Matching Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of classic algorithms for graphs and string matching in Java. The algorithms cover a wide range of applications, from graph processing to efficient string matching.

## Contents

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching in a graph or tree.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching in a graph or tree iteratively.
  - **Shortest Paths in Unweighted Graphs**: Algorithms like BFS to find the shortest paths between nodes in unweighted graphs.
  - **Shortest Paths in Weighted Graphs with Positive Weights**: Algorithms like Dijkstra to find the shortest paths between nodes in weighted graphs with positive weights.
  - **Shortest Paths in Graphs with Negative Weights**: Algorithms like Bellman-Ford to find the shortest paths between nodes in graphs with negative weights.
  - **Topological Sorting**: An algorithm to sort the nodes of a directed acyclic graph.
  - **Shortest Paths in DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: Algorithms to find the shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs.

- **String Matching Algorithms**:
  - **Brute Force**: A simple but inefficient approach to finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text.
  - **Boyer-Moore**: An efficient algorithm for pattern searching in text.
  - **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**: A linear-time algorithm for substring searching in text.
  - **String Matching Automaton**: An efficient method that uses finite automata to search for patterns in text.
